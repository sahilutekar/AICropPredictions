India is characterized by small farms. Over 75% of total land capitals within the country are less than 5 acres. Most crops are rain nourished, with just about 45% of the land irrigated. As per some estimations, about 55% of the total population of India depends on farming. 
Level of supplements like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K), Area kind of soil, supplement estimation of the dirt in that locale can be resolved. Every one of these ascribes information will be examined, training the information with different appropriate AI calculations for making a model. The framework accompanies a model to be exact and precise in foreseeing crop yield and convey the end client with legitimate proposals about required manure proportion dependent on air and soil boundaries of the land which upgrade to expand the harvest yield and increment rancher income.
Harvest yield forecast is the significant exploration which assists with getting food. For the better comprehension of the harvest yield, we need to examine immense information with the assistance of AI calculation and recommend the rancher for a superior harvest.
